Logic part 1:
• we need a character map
  - Prevents us from having more characters then required
  E.g.
  Word: belle
  Guessed: beeee
  Output(without character map): B E e e E
  Output(using character map) B E _ _ E
• we need to check for the exact positions
  - We need to go through the guessed word twice.
    Reason is because we need to get the exact correct letter and correct position first,
    then we get the correct letter but wrong position(**subject to the character map**)
  E.g.
  Word: belle
  Guessed: beeee
  Wrong logic:
  Go through all at once with:
  if(guess[pos] == correct[pos]):
    output[pos] = guess[pos].upper()
  elif(guess[pos] in correct):
    output[pos] = guess[pos].lower()
  This will be wrong
  Correct logic:
