# Installing Next.js

* No longer requires loading react and react dom scripts.

```bash
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest
```

* Use `.jsx` file type instead of `.html`

# Running

Add to package.json

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev"
}
```

# Errors faced

* When running `npm run dev`, a `use client` error occurs.

This is because next.js uses react server components(feature that allows react to render on a server).
Server components don't support useState, will need to use client component.

* `layout.js` file is auto generated by next.js.
